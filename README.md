# StyleCrafting-Artistry-with-Neural-Style-Transfer-
Implementation of Neural Style Transfer using VGG16. The project blends the content of a target image with the style of a reference image by optimizing a weighted loss (content, style via Gram matrices, and total variation) using L-BFGS, generating artistic outputs.
